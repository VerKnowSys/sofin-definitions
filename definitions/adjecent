i'm catching my thoughts
stockpiling wooden figures
  - under the carpet
discovering the attic
  - a show without the audience
hunting whatâ€™s left
  - bashed on the light bulb

driving your attention
somewhere
questions remain an unknown
in adjacent of the pawns

I stay adjacent
to the distance that starts too far
a measure that always been so kind
but now the scent is gone
I stay an apprentice
of prince of me and you
climbing fake mountains

questions remained
an unknown in
adjacent of the pawns
